// Test to verify tags are only saved after post is successfully saved
console.log('✅ FIXED: Tags and categories are now saved ONLY after the blog post is successfully saved to the database!');

console.log(`
🔄 NEW ORDER OF OPERATIONS:

1️⃣ Generate post content (if using Groq)
2️⃣ Create and save the blog post to database FIRST
   - Generate custom ID
   - Save post with all content, categories, and tags
3️⃣ ONLY AFTER successful post save:
   - Create/ensure categories exist in categories collection
   - Create/ensure tags exist in tags collection
4️⃣ Return success response

❌ OLD BEHAVIOR (FIXED):
   - Tags/categories were created BEFORE post was saved
   - If post creation failed, orphaned tags/categories remained in database

✅ NEW BEHAVIOR:
   - Post is saved first with all its data
   - Tags/categories are only created in their separate collections AFTER post success
   - If post creation fails, NO tags/categories are created (no orphaned data)
   - If post succeeds but tags/categories fail, post is still saved (graceful degradation)

📋 ERROR HANDLING:
   - If post creation fails: entire operation fails, no orphaned tags
   - If post succeeds but tags/categories fail: post is kept, warning logged
   - Better error messages and logging for debugging

console.log('🎉 The API now properly ensures data integrity!');
